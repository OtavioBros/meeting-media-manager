# Dear translators

Thank you for your interest in translating this project! This is the GitLocalize project for the documentation website of M³, which is located at: [sircharlo.github.io/meeting-media-manager/](https://sircharlo.github.io/meeting-media-manager/).

One thing to keep in mind is to not translate the `ref` key at the top of each page (present-media, installation, configuration, etc). These are used to connect different translations of the same page.

After having translated a file, please make sure to not only create a review request, but also send a pull request to GitHub. Only then can it be accepted and included in the next release.

Kind regards,

The M³ team
