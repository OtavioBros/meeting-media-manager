# Dear translators

Thank you for your interest in translating this project! This is the GitLocalize project for the documentation website of M³, which is located at: [sircharlo.github.io/meeting-media-manager/](https://sircharlo.github.io/meeting-media-manager/).

One thing to keep in mind is to **not** translate the words in blocks, like `[GH ISSUES]` or `[PRESENT LINK]`. Also the `ref` key needs to be kept the same. These are used to generate links and other things, and should not be translated.

After having translated a file, please make sure to also send a pull request to GitHub. Only then can it be accepted and included in the next release.

Kind regards,

The M³ team
